# Getting Started

Let's create our djangoÂ´s envirounuments that will be running the backend`s part belonged to the project.

## Requirements

- Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)  
- Django (3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2)  
- Django REST Framework (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14)  

## Starting your project at beggininng 

To init any project is Essential to create the **VENV**.

To do it , you need runnnig that command:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your server

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
